I am a Software Engineer and M.S. in Computer Science student at Stony Brook University.

My work focuses on backend and distributed systems, including high-throughput data pipelines, transactional platforms, and production-grade services.

Previously, I worked at Vymo Technologies, where I built scalable Java and Kafka services, improved analytics latency with ClickHouse, and owned workflows from design through on-call support.

Core interests:
- Distributed systems and fault tolerance
- Backend architecture and API design
- Data systems and performance engineering
- Cloud-native deployment and observability

You can find my full experience, education, and technical stack on the [CV page](/cv/) and [JSON CV page](/cv-json/).
