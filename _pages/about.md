I am a Software Engineer and M.S. in Computer Science student at Stony Brook University, focused on building scalable backend and distributed systems.

I have around 3 years of industry experience building high-throughput data platforms, API-driven products, and production systems with strong reliability and performance requirements.

Previously, I worked at Vymo Technologies, where I built scalable Java and Kafka services, improved analytics latency with ClickHouse, and owned workflows from design through on-call support.

I am currently working with Professor Klaus Mueller at Stony Brook University on the following project:

**Replicating Crowdsourcing Platforms with LLM-Based Persona Simulation**  
This project extends an existing Persona Designer Dashboard into a full simulation environment for crowdsourcing-style studies, modeled after platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific. Rather than recruiting anonymous participants, the system lets users create structured groups of synthetic personas defined by personality and socioeconomic dimensions. These personas can then be used to run behavioral experiments, decision-making tasks, framing studies, perception analyses, survey pretests, and policy-response evaluations. Results are aggregated using familiar methods from crowdsourced research, including summary statistics, ranking-based comparisons, and effect estimation, while preserving complete visibility into each persona profile. The goal is to support faster and lower-cost experimental iteration, and to enable systematic comparisons between simulated and human participant outcomes.

Core interests:
- Distributed systems and fault tolerance
- Backend architecture and API design
- Data systems and performance engineering
- Cloud-native deployment and observability
